For the test you need access to a computer with a code editor, docker and node/npm installed.

We will test with you for a short hour, an hour or less.
You will be able to take help of the internet to finish the test.
We will test your competence in programming, as well as your ability to find answers to what you do not know.

You can prepare any work you like before this assignment.
The test is a very simple connection to a MySQL database to perform a simple series of CRUD operations on the targeted entity.
You are advised to look at he following repository at npm to work with mysql: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql
We want you to set up a MySQL container on your computer through a docker command.
The connections to the database is expected to look like:

 - host: localhost
 - port: 3306
 - user: root
 - password: abc123

The database schema you can use looks like the following 
(this schema is not tested, if there is an error in this example, it's not part of the task to solve):

SET NAMES utf8;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `foo`;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `foo`.`bar`
(
    `id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `baz` VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;

The test is expected to resolve into 3 files:

 - package.json
 - repository.js
 - test.js

The repositories interface is expected to be composed of 4 functions:

 - create(bar)
 - fetch(id) 
 - update(id, bar) 
 - delete(id)

The test flow is expected to be written in mocha and chai, but if you feel better about a different tool, then feel free to use what you are comfortable with.
The test flow is expected to cover:

 - an entity can be created through the repository.
 - that entity can be fetched after creation.
 - that entity can be updated after creation.
 - that entity can be deleted  after creation.
